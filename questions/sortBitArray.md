Given a bit array, return it sorted in-place (a bit array is simply an array that contains only bits, either 0 or 1).

See if you can solve this in O(N) time and O(1) auxiliary space.

Try to solve this using a frequency count rather than using multiple pointers, or using a comparison sort function.
